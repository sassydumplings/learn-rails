When you HTTParty, you must party hard!
Post-install message from gibbon:
IMPORTANT: Gibbon now targets MailChimp API 2.0, which is substantially different from API 1.3.
                             Please use Gibbon 0.4.6 if you need to use API 1.3.
If you're upgrading from <0.5.0 your code WILL break.
